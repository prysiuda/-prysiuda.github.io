<p><strong>The Age Difference Matters: How to Make Teams That Span Four Generations Operate Efficiently</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Most managers would admit that maintaining a healthy atmosphere at the workplace can be hard. But it is twice as hard to deal with different generations in one company. Generation Z joined the workforce in 2015. So, Baby boomers, Generation X, Millennials, and newbie Gen Z in the same working boat now. Yes, it is tough to coordinate such a diverse team. Although it is possible and desirable. All of them bring valuable experience and help to look at difficulties from a different angle. The following tips will show how to make a team drive even with 4 working generations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What brings generations' uniqueness.</strong></p>
<p>The eldest category of employers is Baby Boomers or 'Me Generation.' They were born between 1946 and 1964 and represented one-third (31%) of the world workforce. All have a strong work ethic motivated by status, wealth, and prestige. Baby Boomers characterized as:</p>
<p>- career lovers;</p>
<p>- respectful to fair managers;</p>
<p>- extremely loyal to their employers;</p>
<p>- good team players;</p>
<p>- service- and goal-oriented;</p>
<p>- competitive.</p>
<p>The eldest cohort prefers face-to-face communication instead of instant messaging. Also, uncomfortable with conflicts and put process ahead of results.</p>
<p>The next after Baby Boomers is Gen X, who were born between 1965 and 1979. The 'X' accounts for 32% of the workforce. Members of Gen X prefer managers who are honest and genuine. Usually, they aim to career-life balance and growth opportunities. Results-oriented and desire flexibility in how their tasks get done.</p>
<p>Millennials (or Gen Y) were born between 1980 - 1995 and represented 34% of the workforce. Millennials are achievement-oriented and appreciate corporate liability. They are:</p>
<p>- good team players;</p>
<p>- optimistic;</p>
<p>- welcoming regular feedback;</p>
<p>Y Gen craves meaningful tasks and expects to work when and where they want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Generation Z was born between 1996 and 2010.</p>
<p>The youngest employed people prefer to have an impact on the world.</p>
<p>They more technologically plugged in than Millennials and have the highest level of technological connectivity.</p>
<p>All of them are incredibly different. But it brings the uniqueness to businesses. Smart employers just reap the benefits of multigenerational teams. <a href="https://cdn3.onlinemba.unc.edu/content/b5c0038fc225476eb1f7793b0396c3ff/Final_Multigenerational_Workforce_Guide_Optimized_Trial.pdf?_ga=2.69626962.314878877.1560093867-263325246.1560093867">A Guide to Leading the Multigenerational Workforce</a> says that such organizations are more flexible and takes any changes easier. They quickly adapt to market changes.</p>
<p>Companies with old and young employees take better decisions. As the folk wisdom says: 'The best thoughts thrive on conflict.' They understand different audiences. That is the reason they always seek a consensus. The working process in the multigenerational team can be troublesome, but the results worth it.</p>
<p>Such groups usually gain and maintain more market share because they reflect the multigenerational market. Every employee knows the needs in their own niche and implements it in tasks successfully.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moreover, diverse teamwork demonstrates increased innovation and creativity. Young employees have crazy ideas, and elder ones know the ways of bringing them to life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to implement generations' diversity to business and make it flourishing?</strong></p>
<p>This diversity teamwork makes the dream work if leaders know how to organize workflow. First of all, they should avoid making age-based assumptions &amp; stereotyping. Stereotypes never lead to anything good. Especially when it highlights the age difference. The youngest employees could feel not smart enough because of lack of experience. The eldest - too old due to innovations.</p>
<p>The considerable age difference in relationships among colleagues possible to reduce with their commonalities. <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/en-us/business/trends-and-insights/articles/5-secrets-managing-multi-generational-workforce/">Americanexpress.com</a> suggests employers concentrate more on similarities among team members. People should embrace what they share, not what divides them. Otherwise, even the eight-year age difference will lead to communication gaps.</p>
<p>Managers should customize approaches for each employee. Yes, it is hard, but it is not rocket science. All they should do is to pay attention to their colleagues, listen to them, understand their needs, be friendly and helpful.&nbsp; The leader's main task is to organize a pleasant atmosphere in the workplace.</p>
<p>Adopting varying communication styles can help in this way too. According to <a href="https://harver.com/blog/generational-diversity-in-the-workplace/">Harver.com</a>, Baby boomers prefer t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te or mobile phone communications. But younger employees chose instant messaging over it. Leaders can use this knowledge and find the most suitable method for teams' communications.</p>
<p>Setting up informal mentoring opportunities is also useful for teams with age differences. Younger and older employees can mentor one another in unique ways. Generation Z can teach how to use this or that technology. Charge for change elder gens and help them to adapt. In turn, Baby boomers might be able to give significant insight into career growth based on his or her wealth of expertise.</p>
<p>To sum up, the age difference matters in teamwork. Every gen brings its features and benefits. Baby boomers teach to achieve goals. Gen X shows how to be more flexible. Millennials charge with optimism and newbies Z to be more technologically savvy.</p>
<p>Each manager will agree that it is not easy to control even own peers. But when he or she creates a prosperous management system for a multigenerational company, it will undoubtedly become a leader.</p>
