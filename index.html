<p>Branding is key to a successful business. From big corporations to particular individuals - all of them used branding to achieve prosperity. Many authoritative sources do not give step by step recommendations on how to brand yourself. Though numerous young entrepreneurs feel the need for specific recommendations abound brand building. To make the path to success more comfortable, they can find universal tips below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How to build a stand-out personal brand?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.shopify.com/blog/116266245-personal-branding-how-to-market-yourself-without-selling-out">According to Braveen Kumar from Shopify,</a> Personal Branding weaves together entrepreneur life and entrepreneur work in the form of sharing his life's work with an audience. Behind every successful business stands a person who tells everyone about reaching that success. Bill Gates with Microsoft, Steve Jobs with Apple, Mark Zuckerberg with Facebook, Elon Musk with Tesla, Jeff Bezos with Amazon showed to the public how they reached the top. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Young entrepreneurs have to share their own stories. Shed light on motivations, roots, and intentions. They need to find the right part of stories that are worth telling.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Optimizing social profiles can be handy both for telling the brand story and young entrepreneurs personally. It is the place where they can share the info about themselves, who they are, and what they intend to do. As stated by <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/324569">Entrepreneur.com</a>, openness always attracts customers. It is visible on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/RichardBranson/?epa=SEARCH_BOX">Richard Branson's</a> example. He is open to people, and it makes him famous. His popularity means the success of the Virgin Group.</p>
<p>Thirdly, young businesspeople should be noticed. Not only working hard but be visible to other leaders are essential for business. Everyone wants to see who found the company and its progress. <a href="https://www.eonetwork.org/">Entrepreneurs organization</a> is the best place to show yourself, share experience, and be in contact with other managers. It includes up to 8000 entrepreneurs from forty countries.</p>
<p>The fourth tip for brand building involves customers in the working process. Not literally, of course. Company runners have to show some insights from the company work. It can be pictures of the team and office, video of making new products or something else that hidden from the public. Fashion brands like <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dior/?hl=uk">Dior</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/chanelofficial/?hl=uk">Chanel</a> use this technique on Instagram. It increases companies' sales.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The fifth tip lies in defining the brand image. All the photos, images, news logos, websites, business cards, and social media pages should be in one style. The more creative logo the company has, the more trust and respect it gets from customers. Apple is a good example. Firstly, it has a complicated main image like on the first picture but then changed it to a simple and clear one. Everyone knows bitten apple today.</p>

<p>Of course, every founder would agree that branding business is hard. Many companies and people fail on the way to success, even if their products are perfect. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2017/06/21/these-seven-startups-had-amazing-ideas-and-failed/#33199df613ee">Forbes</a> says Ask Jeeves is a bright example of failure. This company was found in 1996. It was one of the first natural language search engines. David Warthen, the founder, even created a safe search for kids. Though, in 2005 the company was bought by IAC and renamed on Ask.com. In 2007 the company declared a failure and was forgotten. Brand probuilding could help to save the business. However, the owners did not see the website's prospects.</p>
<p>Such stories with StartUp flops happen everywhere. Despite it, the young generation of founders should forget about fears and do whatever it takes to succeed. There is a <a href="https://yeausa.org/about/introduction/">Young Entrepreneurs Academy</a> to help inexperienced managers. The program encourages the youth to transform their incredible ideas into enterprises.</p>
<p><strong>Personal branding among youth today.</strong></p>
<p>Nowadays, young people make not only breakthrough StartUps, but brand their personalities. Some of them have personal blogs where they share thoughts and get money for advertisement (<a href="http://garyvaynerchuk.com/">GaryVaynerchuk.com</a>). Others successfully run personal accounts on Twitter, Instagram, or Facebook. The most creative have their own YouTube channels (<a href="https://www.ranker.com/review/david-dobrik/85373171?ref=node_name&amp;pos=1&amp;a=0&amp;ltype=n&amp;l=1959550&amp;g=2">David Dobrik</a>). Such people become famous and grab money just for being themselves.</p>
<p>Plus, youth joins freelance websites and earn money there. Branding yourself on such sites is essential too. When a worker has only high-rated reviews, more customers would like to work with him/her. <a href="https://twitter.com/MaryHam88743151">Mary Hampton</a>, a writer for Essaypro.com, is an example of successful branding on freelance. She and other writers from&nbsp; https://essaypro.com/write-my-essay.html write any paper the best.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To sum up, branding yourself is always tough. The folk says: "No pain, no gain," and it is right. Many founders started their company only with several dollars in the pocket. Yes, some of them failed, but others became the wealthiest people in the world. To be successful is easier today than 20-30 years ago. The Internet gave everyone a chance to make a dream come true. Let's do it together!</p>
