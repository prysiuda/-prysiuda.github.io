<p>Everyone will agree that creative people are the minority of humanity. They regularly impress the rest of the world with their thoughts, ideas, and inventions. They are misunderstood but admired by the average minds. Original people are found in every human age. The luckiest artists were recognized genius alive, while others got this title several decades after the death. But all of them have something in common&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-0 replaced" data-num="0">&mdash;</span>&nbsp;they are different and not afraid to tell about it to the whole planet. They brake all the borders, see something invisible for others. It is believed that creativeness comes from birth or with exceptional genes. However, recent studies proved that everyone can teach himself to be unique. So if one writer does not feel his texts are worth to be called creative, we have some tips for him. Hurry up and get to know how to write extraordinary about ordinary things.<br /><br />Why do not people feel extraordinary enough?<br /><br />The planet is overcrowded with original people, but very often they do not even expect to see themselves in such roles. The reason for it lies in mentality, education, and people around. Society presses on everyone who wants to express himself.&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-1" data-num="1">"</span>You should be like others<span class="wo fr-2" data-num="2">"</span>&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-3 replaced" data-num="3">&mdash;</span>&nbsp;that is what extraordinary people usually hear. Most of them give up under pressure, and only the bravest ones go-ahead to success. Students and schoolchildren feel the biggest stress at school or university. Teenagers can be really ruthless, so expressing oneself becomes impossible for the youth.&nbsp; After graduation, adults forget about their dreams to be unusual and go on living without border-crossing. In this case, students have to understand that they should be who they want to be. Who knows, maybe they will become like&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-4" data-num="4">Elon</span>&nbsp;Mask in the future, gather millions of fans, and change the history.<br /><br />How to find creativeness in oneself?<br /><br />Original people would agree that creativeness should be trained. Dan&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-5" data-num="5">Dowling</span>&nbsp;wrote a training course on creativeness for the Entrepreneur. According to him, people decide by themselves whether they want to be extraordinary. If yes, they should start working on self-confidence, openness, and imagination. Negative thoughts like&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-6" data-num="6">"</span>I can not do it,<span class="wo fr-7" data-num="7">"</span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-8" data-num="8">"</span>I do not deserve it<span class="wo fr-9" data-num="9">"</span>&nbsp;should be changed on&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-10" data-num="10">"</span>I can do whatever I want, cause I am uniqueness.<span class="wo fr-11" data-num="11">"</span>&nbsp;The more a person repeats it to himself, the fewer frames and contradictory ideas will come to his mind. Every day should start with these mantras or affirmations. Only ten minutes daily in the morning will change the whole life for the better. Also, the author&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-12 replaced" data-num="12">suggests encouraging</span>&nbsp;oneself for competed tasks, it will have a high impact on the person's mood.<br />After self-convincing, the man or woman should put words into action and start doing extraordinary things. If he or she dreamed about writing the blog, creating a web-site or even a Twitter page where he can share unexpected thoughts, it is the right time to start. But it has to be not only a one-time activity. From this point, people should begin planning their unusual activities day by day. It will help to reach creativeness faster and get experience in free expression. The best way to plan everything is to get a calendar or a daily planner. This notebook has to be always with&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-13 replaced" data-num="13">its</span>&nbsp;owner, so he or she will have the possibility to add new information whenever they want.<br />When original people share their opinions, they need to know they are not alone, and like-minded people exist. All of them can be taught by each other's experiences and inspire new ideas. Therefore, all creative people need to expand the circle of communication. Nowadays, it is easy to do with social networks help. Only in several months, someone can become a worldwide star.<br />But it does not mean that creative personalities should keep in contact with everyone. The world is full of people who do not understand the artistic inspiration and convince extraordinary people to give up the idea of being unusual. Old friends, teachers at college, and many others can be toxic for creative prosperity. In this case, Dan&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-14" data-num="14">Dowling</span>&nbsp;suggests reducing communication. It will make room for new friends and reduce self-doubting.<br /><br />Everyone should have some teachers or mentors, especially at the beginning of a new career. Newcomers-creators should find some outstanding persons in their city and organize meetings in real life. It will help to understand the psychology of creative people and give some hints on the path to move on. He or she has to make up a list of the most important questions and be ready to write down all he hears.<br /><br />TOP&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-15" data-num="15">-</span>&nbsp;5 tips on writing original texts about ordinary things.<br /><br />After doing all the simple steps counted earlier, people are ready to move on and dig for the creativeness inside themselves. Barry&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-16" data-num="16">Davret</span>&nbsp;shared with<span class="wo fr-17 replaced" data-num="17">&nbsp;</span>Medium several tips on training the muscle of creativity and writing extraordinary texts.<br />First of all, the writers should put themselves in constraints. Yes, it sounds unusual a bit, but the method really works. It forces writers to focus their brains on specific problems. The more limitations writers have, the more creative solutions they find. Mr.&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-18" data-num="18">Davret</span>&nbsp;suggests adding different restrictions to future texts. For example, the writer has a task to write a book about mother-daughter relationships. The constrains: the mother raises her kids all alone, and the daughter has bad affecting relationships with an older boy. Or the task to write an article about living on the tropic islands. Constraints: except for tropical paradise, newcomers will face the total absence of infrastructure and poverty. Writers should practice such exercise daily. Only in this case, the restrictions will become more exciting and solutions more intriguing.<br />The second step in making texts better is finding the benefit of the benefit. The main idea of this exercise is to train the brain to look for new ideas. As an example, we can take the increasing of electric cars. Why is it good?&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-19" data-num="19">Because</span>&nbsp;less CO2 goes to the atmosphere. Why reducing CO2 is good?&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-20" data-num="20">Because</span>&nbsp;it slows the effect of climate change. The artist should go on doing this exercise until really exclusive thoughts will come to his head. At some point, the author will find himself out of ideas, but he should go on doing the exercise, cause only in such situations creative ideas come.<br />The third step towards the best texts lies in finding meaning in the regular things.&nbsp; For example, everyone goes to work, visit a coffee shop in the lunchtime, or walking home through the same park every day. But no one pays attention to the details:<br />1) how a new colleague looks at a young intern girl;<br />2) how barista carefully paint a cream picture on every cup of coffee;<br />3) how a brother teaches his younger sister to ride a bike.<br />The main task of every author is noticing these details and try to add something abstract to them. Barry&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-21" data-num="21">Davret</span>&nbsp;created a scheme to exercise in such situations: concrete + abstract = meaning. For example, barista paints exclusive cream pictures on every cup of coffee, because he hopes to get more positive reviews and as a result, get the salary raising. This exercise trains the imagination.<br />The fourth exercise which every author should use is creating titles in eight words. They need to make up a headline that raises emotional response or intrigue. There is a well-known title by Ernest Hemingway,&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-22" data-num="22">"</span>For Sale: Baby Shoes. Never Worn.<span class="wo fr-23" data-num="23">"</span>&nbsp;This headline makes every reader upset, but it is the brightest example of a brilliant author. Creating short headlines, writers should remember that these words have to conjure up a backstory and wake up the desire to read more.<br />The fifth step towards creating perfect texts deals with finding hidden gems in surrounding things. It can be anything, which caught the author's eye&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-24 replaced" data-num="24">&mdash;</span>&nbsp;from a new coffee shop opened on the corner to a pigeon who is running around. The point is to answer these questions:<br />1) Why this thing is interesting?<br />2) What would make it more enjoyable?<br />3) 'What's the story behind it?<br />All the answers should be written down in the author's notebook. The more often the writer will train his imagination this way, the more impressive stories he will create in the future.<br /><br />Many people started writing texts, but then disappointed with this idea and chose other careers. We at https://essaypro.com/custom-essay-writers.html have many writers who were persistent all the time and transformed their writing hobby into careers. Elisabeth Geller has been working for us for two years and shared the story of her growth. She told us that no one liked her texts for a long time. But she wrote little paragraphs day by day, and in one period her teacher set some Elisabeth' s works like the example of great works. Since that time, more than 10 years have passed, and her works are called the best in the whole office.<br /><br />To sum up, almost everyone is unique and creative. But most of the people are afraid to express themselves, act unusual, and do not to be like others. Moreover, when the person crossed internal borders, he can find that he is not creative enough. But scientists&nbsp;<span class="wo fr-25 replaced" data-num="25">proved</span>&nbsp;that creativeness is like a muscle and can be trained. There are many exercises for becoming a better artist, people should use it daily, and the progress will be seen.</p>
